# BridgedGNN
Data and code of Bridged-GNN, a method following the paradigm of Knowledge Bridge Learning (KBL). This paper is under review.

### Dataset

We preprocessed all datasets used in this paper, including relational and unrelational datasets,  into the format of *torch_geometric*. And our processed datasets are available at `./dataset/xxx.dat` (unzip the file named 'dataset_pyg.tar.gz' in the dataset folder first). And we provide a demo to load the dataset.

### Code

The code will be released at publication time of this paper.
